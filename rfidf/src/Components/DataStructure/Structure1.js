As we understand, our people can never be complacent, can never be apathetic, and can never take our position as a state and in the diaspora for granted. When we say never again is now, we mean it. This is the moment to show what you would have done, what you will do, and how you commemorate the six million who perished and the aftershocks that affect our balance today.
